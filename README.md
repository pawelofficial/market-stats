This is a streamlit app with pgsql backend i'm developing for choosing best stocks to invest in 
Currently:
    - it's able to download ~75 NASDAQ 100 stocks ( with yahoofinance ) 
    - calculate some metrics ( RSI, MACD, 2 custom metrics of mine )
    - display some charts to the user 

TO DO:
    - performance chart 
    - backtesting 
    - wrap downloads in airflow jobs
